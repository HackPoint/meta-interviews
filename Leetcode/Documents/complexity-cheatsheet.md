‚úÖ 2. Complexity Analysis Walkthrough Checklist
üßÆ Use this checklist for every problem:

| Step | Question                                                           |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | How many **layers of loops or recursion**?                         |
| 2    | Are we **copying data** (e.g. `path + [x]`) or modifying in-place? |
| 3    | Are we doing **extra work per node/call** (e.g. sorting, lookup)?  |
| 4    | Are we traversing a tree/graph/list ‚Äî how many **nodes** total?    |
| 5    | Are we storing intermediate results (e.g. memo, result list)?      |
| 6    | What's the **maximum recursion depth** or call stack?              |
| 7    | Are there **duplicate calls** due to missing memoization?          |
| 8    | Final answer: time = #calls √ó cost per call?                       |

‚úÖ 3. Visual Recursion Tree Example
Let's say we call dfs(i) that branches into 2 calls unless i == n.

üéÑ Recursion Tree for dfs(i) with i < n branching to dfs(i+1) and dfs(i+2):
```scss
dfs(0)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dfs(1)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dfs(2)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dfs(3)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dfs(2)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
Each level has more calls ‚Üí total calls grow exponentially ‚Üí O(2‚Åø)
