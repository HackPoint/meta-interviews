/// 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor
///
/// Problem:
/// Given a binary tree, find the maximum value of |ancestor.val - node.val|
/// for all pairs (ancestor, descendant) where ancestor is higher on the path
/// from the root to node (excluding node itself as its own ancestor).
///
/// Approach (Short, Easy, Fast):
/// - Use DFS from the root, carrying along two values: `minPath` and `maxPath`
///   â€” the minimum and maximum values seen so far along the current root-to-node path.
/// - At each node:
///     1. Update `minPath` and `maxPath` with node's value.
///     2. Compute the difference between node's value and both extremes.
///     3. Update a global `maxDiff` if this difference is larger than the previous max.
/// - Recurse into left and right children with updated `minPath` and `maxPath`.
///
/// Time Complexity:
/// - O(n): each node is visited exactly once.
///
/// Space Complexity:
/// - O(h): recursion stack, where h is the height of the tree.
///
/// Correctness & Edge Cases:
/// - Handles trees with only one node (result = 0).
/// - Works for skewed trees (worst-case height = n).
/// - Works for all values in the allowed range.
/// 
/// Example:
/// Input:
///     8
///    / \
///   3   10
///  / \    \
/// 1   6    14
///
/// Output:
/// - Max diff = |8 - 1| = 7.
